# Exploring Vibe Coding Tools – Antigravity (Bakery Landing Page)

This project is part of my exploration of **vibe coding tools** (AI-assisted platforms) that help generate frontend code quickly and creatively. For this experiment, I tried **Antigravity** to create a simple bakery (**Crumbly**, that's what I named it 😋) landing page using **HTML** and **CSS**.

## Goal
- Explore **vibe coding tools** and understand their workflow  
- Learn how AI-generated layouts and styles are structured  
- Customize and tweak the code to make it my own  

## Tools Used
- **Antigravity** (Vibe Coding Tool)  
- **HTML**  
- **CSS**

## About
I used Antigravity to generate the initial code, then reviewed it to better understand how AI can assist in web development. The experience was impressive and fun, surprising tbh, and it gave me insight into how vibe coding tools can speed up prototyping while still allowing creative control.
